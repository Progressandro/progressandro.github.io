I started as a Freelancer at Upwork, but quickly realized that I needed to experience with an organization to be able to improve my code quality and also to be part of bigger, more ambitious projects, so then I started working in companies. You can read more about them at the "Work" section. :)
    
    PD: I've also done some projects in my free time, those are listed at... Well... "Projects" section, pretty obvious.`,
